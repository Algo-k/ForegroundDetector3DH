ForegroundDetector3DH 

<br><br>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
This code target is only one class ( CppLibImaging::ForegroundDetector3DH) that conducts some calculations to produce the best "Foreground Color" for a background image or the best "Background Color" for a foreground entity like "Rich Text" or a set of colorful objects. I needed this class thus I created it and this project is still in progress. This class is written in C++ CLR ( C++ .Net ) but you can migrate it to native C++ easily ( No license currently exists ).
Immediately after creating instance of this class you should call "ForegroundDetector3DH::Create" function to initialize the ForegroundDetector3DH instance.
